    <h2><big><p style="color:green;">Is I Am Introvert</big></h2>
<p><big>What does introvert means?To whome the society called the introvert?At first the word "introvert" it self was a new english word for me.Being introvert I was unknown about the meaning of word "introvert". Sometime I just think who the hell is there to descover or what we called this person who yearly discover some new english word.I also thing some other non-sense quesntion like at past how people used to express there feeling when the sentence "I Love You" was not discovered.I know this question doesnot make nay sense but that kind of question always run in my mind. ohh one thing if you know, if you are introvert then you are defenitely a overthinker.Sometime its feel like my head would blast because of over thinking.I think I am going out of topic, lets go back to our main topic.So at first I listen this word "introvert" in my college.A boy was saying himself a introvert and at that time the word "introvert" it self was a new to me.After returning from my college I opened my laptop and google the meaning of word "introvert".I was surprise by seeing its meaning, literaly for sometime I thought google was describing me, about my life.Because <big><i>My life=Intovert</i></big>. I thought this word was discover to describe me/my life.At this point I knew that I am introvert.

  I think know one is introvert from their childhood.The time and situation or some accident make us introvert.Or may not be this is just my point of view.I am not a some phd holder professior or scientist to prove this.In your case i don't know if you are a introvert then you can think once, are you a introvert from your childhood?
  but I was not.I still remember when I used to go to play outside with my friends I wouldn't return back home till it become dark.I used to be out of my house early morning after taking food and wouldn't return back till it become dark.I used to have a lots of friend.Till class 6 or 7 I used to talk a lots,play a lots of thing with friend,used to stay outside of house maximum time.I thik I was in class 6 when i suffer from <big><i>Jundice</i></big>.Because of this I had to stay nearly 1 years inside house in my room.Because Doctor suggested me to stay away from sunlight and doing heavy works.I was unable go to school, talks and play with friend.At that age,in country like our children are not given mobile phone at that time.I was alone, no one to talk.I still remember I used to do drawing at that time.I think I still have some of them with me , if I find it than I will attached it.Ya this is all about me I become an Introvert.

  If you are a introvert then you may know that our must loving /favourite place is our bedroom with mobile/laptop with internet.If this things are with us and food to...we don't care about rest of the world.No matter what is going on outside of the house.We have No interest in such things.

  In my case I often like to stay alone.I just hate un-necessary noise.I don't like presents of some extra member in my family,I just feel uncomfortable infront of guest.How and what to talk with them.
